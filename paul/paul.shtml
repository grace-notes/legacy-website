         <h2>Paul the Apostle</h2>

         <p>This course is based on the book <b>The Life and Epistles of St. Paul</b>, 
		 by W. J. Conybeare and J. S. Howson. 
		 This book is one of the most often read and quoted books by 
		 Bible teachers and pastors for several generations who have 
		 taught the Acts of the Apostles. 
		 It is rich in history, geography, and sound doctrinal teaching.</p>
