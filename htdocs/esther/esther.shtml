         <h2>ESTHER</h2>

         <p>This expositional Bible study of the book of Esther was written by
         Dr. Daniel Hill when he was the Pastor of Southwood Bible Church in
         Tulsa, Oklahoma. He taught the complete book, verse by verse, to his
         congregation there. He has made his notes available to Grace Notes for
         development into course materials.</p>

         <p>God's sovereign power is magnificently displayed in the story of
         Esther. The Jews in Jerusalem could read this and be greatly
         encouraged knowing that if God is in control in Babylon, how much more
         so with those in Jerusalem, in his geographical will, who are calling
         daily upon the name of the most high God.</p>

         <p>Today we can take great comfort and encouragement from
         this story. There are believers, Christians today out of the will
         of God; but God is still in control just as He was in Esther's day. For
         those who know that they are in God's will, how much more is God in
         control of every facet of their lives.</p>
