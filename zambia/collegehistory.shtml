            <h3>TIMELINE</h3>

            <div class="indent">
               <h4>4 FEBRUARY 2007</h4>

               <p class="description">Grace Bible College of Kabwe (GBCK) began
               as a vision of Pastor Nsofwa and the leadership of his church.
               On 4 February 2007, the church ratified a constitution, which
               had as a Vision Statement "To win the lost to saving faith in
               Jesus Christ through Bible teaching, preaching and care
               ministries."</p>

               <p class="description">That constitution also contained the core
               of a strategy for carrying out the church's vision. In Article 6
               which established the various committees for conducting church
               activities, the text of Section 8, "Education / Discipleship
               Committee" contains the following paragraphs.</p>

               <div class="indent">
                  <p class="description"><b>Subsection (a)</b> - <i>"The church
                  education / discipleship committee shall serve as the
                  training unit of the church, and lead the church in planning,
                  conducting, and evaluating a comprehensive program of
                  Christian education."</i></p>

                  <p class="description"><b>Subsection (b)</b> <i>"Its [the
                  Education Committee]tasks shall be to equip church members
                  for discipleship and personal ministry; to teach Christian
                  theology and Baptist doctrine, Christian ethics, Christian
                  history, and church policy and organization; to equip leaders
                  for service; and to interpret and under gird the work of the
                  church ..."</i></p>

                  <p class="description">On the basis of these directives,
                  Pastor Nsofwa, and the church leaders, began to develop and
                  carry out plans for a teaching ministry to meet these
                  needs.</p>

                  <p class="description">These plans include operating a school
                  for the general education needs of the community. This is
                  expressed among the Objectives in the constitution:</p>

                  <p class="description"><b>Objective 4 (h)</b> - <i>"To
                  establish a Christian community Centre/School to help
                  alleviate illiteracy."</i></p>
               </div>
            </div>

            <div class="indent">
               <h4>22 NOVEMBER 2008</h4>

               <p class="description">For nearly two years, the Kabwe church
               was involved in establishing its Sunday School, evangelistic
               outreach, and community aid projects. During this time, they
               were burdened with the idea of conducting some higher level
               training for people who would become Bible teachers and
               evangelists. They saw that leadership training was needed in the
               Kabwe area, and many surrounding churches were very eager to
               have help with formal instruction in teaching the Word of
               God.</p>

               <p class="description">Pastor Nsofwa and his wife Luta are
               graduates of the Baptist theological seminary in Lusaka. Pastor
               Nsofwa began teaching some men in the church from some of the
               course materials he had used in seminary, teaching subjects such
               as Old and New Testament Survey, Homiletics, Hermeneutics. He
               was teaching these classes on Saturdays, and after some time, he
               shared his vision of a Bible College with the church.</p>

               <p class="description">On 22 November 2008, at a meeting of the
               Pastor and deacons, a resolution was adopted which established a
               Bible College which would provide this kind of teacher
               training.</p>

               <p class="description">Pastor Nsofwa began to meet with leaders
               of several evangelical churches in Kabwe, to discuss the vision
               of establishing a Bible College in Kabwe. While one immediate
               concern was for funding, there was definitely a high interest
               among the churches for having good seminary-level
               instruction.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="indent">
               <h4>25 JUNE 2011</h4>

               <p class="description">At this time Pastor Nsofwa had been
               working as a public school evangelist for several years, each
               week going into six to eight schools to preach the Gospel.</p>

               <p class="description">At the same time, Pastor Nsofwa was
               teaching about fifteen (15) Bible college students on a regular
               basis, meeting with them weekly for instruction. The student
               body included men who were themselves pastors of local
               churches.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="indent">
               <h4>JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2012</h4>

               <p class="description">Pastor Nsofwa became aware of the Grace
               Notes project early in 2012. He wrote to Warren Doud, the
               director of Grace Notes, to request a CD-ROM of the Grace Notes
               library, to be installed on the Mac laptop which he had
               obtained.</p>

               <p class="description">By this time, the Bible College student
               body had increased. When Pastor Nsofwa received the laptop, with
               Grace Notes installed, he immediately began printing lessons
               from the Grace Notes files, UNIT I lessons in Doctrine and the
               Epistle to Titus.</p>

               <p class="description">The college students immediately realized
               that there was value is studying Grace Notes courses, because
               they are accurate, written in understandable English, and are
               organized so as to be well suited for a college curriculum.
               Furthermore, as Pastor Nsofwa made it known what he could now
               offer, there was a good response from prospective students.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="indent">
               <h4>1 JULY 2012</h4>

               <p class="description">By 1 July 2012 there were at least 20
               men, and three women, who were doing regular study in their
               Bible College courses. At this time, the Grace Notes leadership
               began to provide financial and material support to the Bible
               College.</p>

               <p class="description">Grace Notes is sponsored by the Austin
               Bible Church (ABC), in Austin, Texas, of which Bob Bolender is
               pastor. Pastor Bob made himself acquainted both with the Bible
               College effort in Kabwe, Zambia. As a result, the Kabwe Central
               Baptist Church and ABC are sister churches, and people from ABC
               support the Kabwe effort with prayer and financial
               donations.</p>

               <p class="description">During July and August support was
               received which allowed for the purchase of a new Laser Printer,
               a Lenovo laptop computer, and other peripheral equipment and
               software. These were obtained and shipped to Zambia in late
               August and early September. Pastor Nsofwa is the only person who
               has a computer or any type of Internet access. All of the Grace
               Notes lessons must be printed, therefore, and distributed to
               each student. The printed lessons are used, along with a Bible,
               for a student's study. Examinations are completed at home,
               turned in during class, and graded by Pastor Nsofwa. He reports
               the results to Grace Notes. Grace notes maintains student
               records and prints certificates of completion and diplomas to be
               mailed to Kabwe.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="indent">
               <h4>16 SEPTEMBER 2012</h4>

               <p class="description">During the summer of 2012, the student
               body grew to 52. Among these are 15 local pastors, and 10
               elders, deacons, and church officers, from various churches;
               these believers have seen the effect that Grace Bible College
               training has had on their own ministries. In early September,
               Pastor Nsofwa met with a group of 18 people in the Nakoli . They
               organized a class there, which Pastor Nsofwa teaches on another
               day of the week. He now holds three weekly sessions, for a total
               of 12 hours teaching, in addition to his Sunday and weekday
               teaching at his church.</p>

               <p class="description">On the 16th of September 2012, the Kabwe
               Central Baptist Church leadership voted to change the name of
               the college to <b>Grace Bible College of Kabwe</b>.</p>

               <p class="description">Eager students of the Word of God are
               working very hard to improve their knowledge of the Bible, their
               ability to win people to Christ, and to minister to their
               churches. Many churches in the world would be very happy to have
               such a motivated, spiritually dedicated core of believers
               growing in the use of their spiritual gifts.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>A GROWING STUDENT BODY</h3>

            <div class="indent">
               <p class="description">We expect the student body will expand
               further. Pastor Nsofwa is providing a denomination-neutral
               teaching ministry which is appreciated. Some of the students are
               from his church, but many are from other churches. Both Grace
               Notes and the Kabwe Central Baptist Church have uncompromising
               doctrinal positions; however, the manner in which the teaching
               is presented allows considered discussions within the framework
               of Scripture. The students are immersed in the Word of God,
               which all of them enjoy and desire.</p>

               <p class="description">The first ten (10) students, who started
               Grace Notes studies earlier this year, have completed Unit I.
               They studied a Doctrine course, the books of Titus and Ruth, a
               ten-lesson History course, and Foundations (a course on how to
               study the Bible). This was a total of fifty (50) individual
               lessons. Unit II also has five courses, but there are seventy
               (70) lessons. It's a blessing to see the appetite of people for
               Bible doctrine, and it is a great management challenge.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>TRANSLATION INTO BEMBA</h3>

            <div class="indent">
               <p class="description">Bemba is the language spoken by 20% of
               the people in Zambia. Kabwe is one of the centers of Bemba
               people. Pastor Nsofwa is Bemba, as are many of his church
               members, several of his fellow pastors, and the students. Bemba
               is the language used for worship and teaching in the
               churches.</p>

               <p class="description">Although the present pastors and students
               understand English fairly well, they would be much better able
               to absorb the concepts of their courses if they could also read
               them in Bemba.</p>

               <p class="description">Pastor Nsofwa realizes that there is a
               considerable number of people who don't know English, but who
               are eager to take part in the Bible College studies. He, and
               other senior pastors, could use translated Grace Notes courses
               to teach these folks. There would be a significant growth in the
               student body!</p>

               <p class="description">We are starting to plan a translation
               effort. Pastor Nsofwa has identified people who can do accurate
               translation. He will provide editorial oversight, and others
               will be engaged to do proofreading, data entry, etc. There will
               be a need to pay for translation services, but Pastor Nsofwa
               doesn't know yet what the cost will be. There is also a need for
               equipment to be used by translators.</p>

               <p class="description">Pray for this effort, and consider
               whether you want a part in this support.</p>
