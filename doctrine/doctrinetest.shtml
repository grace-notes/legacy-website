<h3>Test of Basic Bible Knowledge</h3>
<b><p>Download PDF: <a href="/documents/TOPICS_DOC/DoctrineTest.pdf" target="_blank">TEST</a> </p></b>
<p>The following questions deal with many of the Bible topics which are considered basic to the Christian Way of Life. Doctrines are not called "basic" because they are simple to learn, trivial, or "baby food", even though they are appropriate topics for new Christians to learn.</p> 
<p>Basic doctrines are, rather, those which are fundamental to the Christian Way of Life and spiritual growth and which are prerequisites to the study of advanced concepts of the Bible.</p>

<p><b>Note: there is no answer key for this "test". It is provided as a method for self-assessment of your knowledge of Bible truth.</b> You can find study materials for these concepts in the <a href="/GN_TopicsLibrary.shtml" target="_blank">Grace Notes Topics Library</a></p>
<p><b>Scoring</b>: Give yourself <b>one</b> point for each question you are certain you could explain completely and correctly to another person.</p>

<h4>EVALUATING YOUR "SCORE"</h4>

<p>Your score indicates the following ( the numbers are quite arbitrary, of course):</p>
<div class="indent">
<p><b>75 to 100</b> - More than a "passing" grade. Indicates you have a good basic foundation and are ready to study advanced topics. Your personal witnessing and other exercise of spiritual gifts is well supported by your understanding of God's Person and Plan. This score would be the minimum expected of anyone going into Christian work as a vocation, such as evangelism, encouragement, or mission support work. This score would also be considered a prerequisite for those entering seminary to prepare for the pastorate.</p>
<p><b>50 to 74</b> - Indicates good progress in basics and that you have been serious in your desire to learn God's Word to this point. Consider increasing the time spent in attending class and studying. Ask your pastor to suggest doctrinal materials or tape studies to supplement classes.</p>
<p><b>25 to 34</b> - Indicates some progress in basics. If you're over 18, you're going to have to put yourself into crash program mode to learn the fundamentals - two or more hours per day of directed, organized study, using any doctrinal classes, tapes, materials that you can find. Progress towards Christian maturity requires consistency, hard work, and dedication.</p>
<p><b>0 to 24</b> - "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God." While you did not need much knowledge of God or the Bible to be saved, you will need a lot of information from the Word of God about how to think and function as a productive Christian.</p>
