      <p>Importance of Revelation</p>
      </font>
      </b>
      <font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2">
      <p>Revelation is the culmination of all books of the Bible Revelation brings to
conclusion the many prophesies of the Bible Revelation puts in context the
end-time events for God's purpose for creation</p>
      <b>
      <p>Author</p>
      </b>
      <p>A. Justin Martyr directly affirms that John was the author</p>
      <p>B. Irenaeus (disciple of Polycarp, who in turn was a pupil of the apostle
John) attributes the writing of Revelation to John</p>
      <p>&quot;Not very long time since, but almost in our day towards the end of
Domitian’s reign.&quot; Domitian died in AD 96, John was then allowed to
return to Ephesus</p>
      <p>C. Others: Clement, Origin, Tertullian, Hippolytus</p>
      <p>D. John’s name occurs as the author: 1:1,4,9; 22:8</p>
      <p>E. Irenaeus, Justin Martyr, Eusebius, Apollonius, and Theophilus, the bishop
of Antioch all accepted Revelation as inspired Scripture</p>
      <p>F. By the 3rd century, Revelation was widely quoted as Scripture</p>
      <b>
      <p>Occasion of Writing</p>
      </b>
      <p>A. Direct command (1:10-23)</p>
      <p>B. Condition of the churches</p>
      <p>1. Fierce persecution at times (not a universal policy) One Christian already
executed (2:13)</p>
      <p>2. Serious problems within the churches: Ephesus (2:2) Smyrna (2:10) Pergamum
(2:13) Thyatira (2:22) Philadelphia (3:10)</p>
      <b>
      <p>Date of Writing -- AD 96</p>
      <p>Place of Writing -- Patmos, a penal colony (where John was exiled)</p>
      </b>
      <p>A small rocky island in the Aegean Sea, 48 km from Ephesus 18-13 km long and
1.5 km wide</p>
      <b>
      <p>Purposes</p>
      </b>
      <p>A. To give the final truth about Jesus Christ the unveiling of His person,
power and purpose (1:1)</p>
      <p>B. To show the ultimate triumph of the Kingdom of Christ</p>
      <p>C. To give a new perspective on history</p>
      <p>D. To give incentive for holy living</p>
      <p>E. To show that God will ultimately deal with the problem of evil</p>
      <p>F. To give a preview of future events</p>
      <b>
      <p>Theme: The revelation of Jesus Christ (1:1; cf. 1:7; 3:11; 22:30)</p>
      </b>
      <p>Revelation is Christ centered</p>
      <b>
      <p>Key Words</p>
      </b>
      <p>&quot;revelation&quot; (unveiling) &quot;lamb&quot; (29times)</p>
      <b>
      <p>Key Verse</p>
      </b>
      <p>&quot;Write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the
things which will take place after this&quot; (1:19).</p>
      <b>
      <p>Addressees (1:11)</p>
      </b>
      <p>A. All churches situated in Proconsular Asia</p>
      <p>B. Churches selected as representatives for churches today</p>
      <p>C. Located in the western third of modern Turkey</p>
      <p>D. John came to Ephesus in 67-70 (Ephesus, the capital of Proconsular Asia)</p>
      <b>
      <p>Reasons Revelation Must Be Clearly Understood</p>
      </b>
      <p>A. It is a &quot;revelation&quot; (apocalypse) which means an unveiling.
(contrast an apocryphal book which is hidden)</p>
      <p>B. Revelation is not a sealed book (22:10)</p>
      <p>C. A blessing is promised to the people who read and to those who hear the
words of this prophecy (1:3)</p>
      <p>D. The last analysis of the book is simple (1:19)</p>
      <b>
      <p>Theology: -- Christological (1:1-3; cf. 5:47; 19:11, 16, 17; 21:9)</p>
      </b>
      <p>A. Person of Christ chapter one</p>
      <p>B. Glorious reign of Christ (complete victory over Satan)</p>
      <b>
      <p>Apocalyptic Character of the Book</p>
      </b>
      <p>A. An apocalyptic book unfolds the future</p>
      <p>B. &quot;apokalupsis&quot;--removing of a veil; Revelation is written to be
understood</p>
      <p>C. Symbolism of the book is found elsewhere no less than 400 allusions to the
Old Testament</p>
      <p>D. Daniel and Ezekiel are similar in style</p>
      <b>
      <p>Miscellaneous Matters</p>
      </b>
      <p>A. Revelation is the cap stone of Scripture</p>
      <p>B. Revelation is the only prophetical book in the New Testament</p>
      <p>C. Revelation bears similar features to the book of Daniel</p>
      <p>D. Revelation is the only book with a promise of blessing to readers (1:3)</p>
      <p>E. Contains 22 chapters, 404 verses and 12,000 words</p>
      <p>1. 285 verses contain Old Testament language</p>
      <p>2. 70 references to angels</p>
      <p>3. No quotes from the Old Testament</p>
      <p>F. Seven beatitudes: 1:3; 14:13; 16:15; 19:9; 20:6; 22:7,14</p>
      <p>G. The chronological construction of the book gives the prophetic program
(1:19)</p>
      <p>H. Over one half of the book describes the tribulation</p>
      <p>I. The number seven occurs frequently throughout the book</p>
      <p>J. A prophecy is a prevision of the future</p>
      <p>K. Revelation was written in order to be understood</p>
      <p>L. The symbolism of the book furnishes the key to the interpretation of the
book</p>
      <p>M. Revelation is a book of consummation</p>
      <b>
      <p>Interpretations</p>
      <p>A. ALLEGORICAL VIEW</p>
      </b>
      <p>1. Definition: the Book of Revelation is an extensive allegory interpreted
non-literally</p>
      <p>2. Symbolic picture of the struggle between good and evil</p>
      <p>3. Originated in the Alexandrian school (Clement of Alexandria, Origin)</p>
      <p>4. Goes far beyond natural symbolism</p>
      <p>5. Influenced Augustine and Jerome</p>
      <p>6. Problem: too subjective</p>
      <b>
      <p>B. PRETERIST VIEW</p>
      </b>
      <p>1. Definition: Latin for &quot;past.&quot; Revelation has already been
fulfilled in the early church (by the time of Constantine, AD 312)</p>
      <p>2. A symbolic history of the first century</p>
      <p>3. Problem: ignores specific predictions (1:3, 19; 22:18, 19); gives
arbitrary meaning to symbols</p>
      <b>
      <p>C. HISTORICAL VIEW</p>
      </b>
      <p>1. Definition: the Book of Revelation is a symbolic picture of the history of
the church between the first and second comings of Christ.</p>
      <p>2. Held by many post-millennialists who believe that the world is getting
better and this will usher in the Kingdom of Christ.</p>
      <p>3. Problem: No two interpreters agree as to which passage refers to which
event. They each finds fulfillment of a given passage in their own generation.</p>
      <b>
      <p>D. FUTURISTIC VIEW</p>
      </b>
      <p>1. Limited to conservative scholars only</p>
      <p>2. Allows for literal (normal) interpretation of prophecy while recognizing
symbolism</p>
      <p>3. Offers a relatively clear understanding of the principal events of future
fulfillment</p>
      <p>4. Structure of the book revolves around chronology: Chapters 1-3: Church Age
Chapters 4-22: Future Events</p>
      <p>5. Objection: Those opposed to this view say that Revelation would not
comfort if it were largely future</p>
