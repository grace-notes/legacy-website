         <p class="cambria">Missionaries on the foreign field, nationals in
         many countries, and people in North America who live far from
         Bible-teaching churches, have the common problem of lack of access to
         Bible instruction.</p>

         <p class="cambria">Grace Notes delivers expositional
         Bible teaching to people who do not have ready access to
         face-to-face teaching by a pastor/teacher in a local church. Most of
         the Bible studies in the Grace Notes curriculum are the written notes
         from pastors who have taught books of the Bible to their own
         congregations.</p>

         <p class="cambria">Many pastors and teachers use Grace Notes courses
         both for help in preparation for teaching and for use in classes held
         in Sunday schools, home schools, cell churches, and other venues where
         the Word of God is taught.</p>

         <p class="cambria">An example of this application is seen in the Grace
         Notes-sponsored ministry of the Kabwe Central Baptist Church in
         Zambia. Pastor Gabriel Nsofwa uses Grace Notes in his teaching
         ministry of the church, and he conducts Bible College classes for
         local pastors, church leaders, and student teachers, using Grace Notes
         for the core curriculum. Click on the link to the Kabwe church&#39;s

         <p class="cambria">Grace Notes offers twelve (12) Units of course
         work, each unit roughly analogous to a semester of Bible College
         instruction. Students can earn certificates for each course completed,
         Unit certificates, and Diplomas for completing various portions of the
         curriculum. See the course descriptions here: <a href=
