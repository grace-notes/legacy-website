</ol>

<h3><a id="faith"></a>5.  Articles of Faith</h3>
<ol class="typea" type="a">
<li><b>The Scriptures:</b> We believe that the Holy Bible was written by men divinely inspired and is the record of God's revelation of Himself to man. It is a perfect treasure of divine instruction. It has God for its author, salvation for its end, and truth, without any mixture of error, for its matter. It reveals the principles by which God judges us; and therefore is, and will remain to the end of the world, the true center of Christian union, and the supreme standard by which all human conduct, creeds and religious opinions should be tired. We believe that the Bible is the only authority in the governing and exercising of our life and our church.<br /><br />
Ex. 24:4, Deut. 4:1-2; Josh 8:34; Psalm 19:7-10; 119:11, 89, 105; Isa.34:16; 40:8; Jer. 15:16; Matt. 5:17-18; 22:29; Luke 21:33; John 5:39; 16:13-15; 12:17; Acts 2:16ff; 17:11; Rom. 15:4; 16:25-26; 2 Tim. 3:15-17; Heb. 1:1-2; 1Pet. 1:25; 2 Pet. 1:19-21.</li>
<li><b>God</b>: We believe that there is one and only one living and true God. He is an intelligent, Spiritual, and Personal Being, the Creator, Redeemer, Preserver and Ruler of the Universe. We believe that God is infinite in holiness and all other perfections. To Him we owe the highest love, reverence, and obedience. We believe that the eternal God reveals Himself to us as Father, Son and Holy Spirit, with distinct personal attributes, but without division of nature, essence, or being.</li>
<ol type="i">
<li><b>God the Father: </b>God as Father reigns with providential care over His universe, His creatures, and the flow of the stream of human history according to the purposes of His grace. He is all powerful, all loving, and all wise. God is Father in truth to those who become children of God through faith in Jesus Christ. He is fatherly in His attitude toward all men.<br /><br />
Gen. 1:1; 2:7; Ex. 3:14; 6:2-3; 15:11ff; Psalm 19:1-3; Isa. 43:3, 15;64:8; Matt. 6:9ff; 7:11; 23:9; 28:19; Mark 1:9-11; John 4:24; 5:26; 14:6-13; Acts 1:7; Rom. 8:14-15; Eph. 4:6; Col. 1:15; John 5:7.</li>
<li><b>God the Son</b>: Christ is the eternal Son of God. In His incarnation as Jesus Christ He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. Jesus perfectly revealed and did the will of God, taking upon Himself the demands and necessities of human nature and identifying Himself completely with mankind yet without sin. He honoured the divine law by His personal obedience, and in His death on the cross He made provision for the redemption of men from sin. He was raised from the dead with a glorified body and appeared to His disciples as the person who was with them before His crucifixion. He ascended into heaven and is now exalted at the right hand of God where He is the One Mediator, and partaking of the nature God and of man, and in whose Person is effected the reconciliation between God and man. He will return in power and glory to judge the world and consummate His redemptive mission. He now dwells in all believers as the living and ever present Lord.<br /><br />
Gen. 18:1ff; Psalm 2:7ff; Matt. 1:18-23; 3:17; 8:29; 11:27; John 1:1-18, 29; 10:30; Acts 1:9; 2:22-24; 7:55-56; Eph. 1:20; 3:11; 4:7-10; 1Pet. 2:21-25; 1John 1:7-9; Rev. 19:16.</li>
<li>God the Holy Spirit: The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God. He inspired holy men of old to write the Scriptures. Through illumination He enables men to understand truth. He exalts Christ. He convicts of sin, of righteousness and of judgement. He calls men to the Saviour, and effects regeneration. He cultivates Christian character, comforts
 believers, and bestows the spiritual gifts by which they serve God through His church. He seals the believer unto the day of final redemption. His presence in the Christian is the assurance of God to bring the believer into the fullness of the stature of Christ. He enlightens and empowers the believer and the church in worship, evangelism, and service.
<br /><br />
Gen. 1:2; Psalm 51:11; 139:7ff; Isa. 61:1-3; John 4:24; 14:16-17, 26; 15:26; 16:17-14; 1Cor. 2:10-14; 3:16; 12:3-11; Eph. 1:13-14; 4:30; 5:18; Heb. 9:8, 14; 2Pet. 1:21; Rev. 1:10.</li>
</ol>
<li><b>Man: </b>We believe that man was created by the special act of God, in His own image, and is the crowning work of His creation. In the beginning man was innocent of sin and was endowed by his Creator with freedom of choice. By his free choice man sinned against God and brought sin into the human race. Through the temptation of Satan man transgressed the command of God, and fell from his original innocence; whereby his posterity inherit a nature and an environment inclined toward sin, and as soon as they are capable of moral action become transgressors and are under condemnation. Only the grace of God can bring man into His holy fellowship and enable man to fulfill the creative purpose of God. The sacredness of human personality is evident in that God created man in His own image, and in that Christ died for man; therefore, everyman possesses dignity and is worthy of respect and Christian love.<br /><br />
Gen. 1:26-30; 2:5,7,18; 3; 9:6; Matt. 16:26; Rom. 1:19-32; 3:10-18, 23; 5:6; 1Cor. 1:21-22; 3:9-11.</li>
<li><b>Salvation</b>: we believe that Salvation involves the redemption of the whole man, and is offered freely to all who accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour, who by His own blood obtained eternal redemption for the believer. In its broadest sense salvation includes regeneration, sanctification, and glorification.</li>
<ol type="i">
<li><b>Regeneration</b>: We believe that regeneration, or the new birth, is a work of God's grace whereby believers become new creatures in Christ ` Jesus. It is a change of heart wrought by the Holy Spirit through conviction of sin, to which the sinner responds in repentance toward God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Repentance and faith are inseparable experiences of grace. <br /><br />
We believe that <b>repentance</b> is a genuine turning from sin toward God. Faith is the acceptance of Jesus Christ and commitment of the entire personality to Him as Lord and Saviour.<br /><br />
<b>Justification</b> is God's gracious and full acquittal upon principles of His righteousness of all sinners who repent and believe in Christ. Justification brings the believer into a relationship of peace and favour with God.</li>
<li><b>Sanctification</b> is the experience, beginning in regeneration, by which the believer is set apart to God's purposes, and is enabled to progress toward moral and spiritual perfection through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in him. Growth in grace should continue throughout the regenerate person's life. </li>
<li><b>Glorification</b>: We believe that glorification is the culmination of salvation and is the final blessed and abiding state of the redeemed.</li>
</ol>

<li><b>God's purpose of Grace</b>: We believe that election is the gracious purpose of God, according to which He regenerates, sanctifies and glorifies sinners. It is consistent with the free agency of man, and comprehends all the means in connection with the end. It is a glorious display of God's Sovereign goodness, and is infinitely wise, holy and unchangeable. It excludes boasting and promotes humility. <br /><br />
All true believers endure to the end. Those whom God has accepted in Christ, and sanctified by His Spirit, will never fall away from the state of Grace, but shall persevere to the end. Believers may fall into sin through neglect and temptation, whereby they grieve the Holy Spirit, impair their graces and comforts, bring reproach on the cause of Christ, and temporal judgments on themselves, yet they shall be kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.<br /><br />
Gen. 12:1-3; Ex. 19:5-8; Luke 1:68-69; 2:29-32; 19:41-44; John 1:12-14; 3:16; 5:24; 6:44-45, 65; 10:27-29; 15:16; 17:16, 12, 17-18; Acts 20:32; Rom 8:28-39; 10:12-15; 11:5-7, 26-36</li>

<li><b>The Church</b>: We believe that Christ is the only head of the Church. A New Testament Church of the Lord Jesus Christ is a local body of baptized believers who are associated by covenant in the faith and fellowship of the gospel, observing two ordinances of Christ, committed to His teachings, exercising the gifts, rights and privileges invested in them by His word, and seeking to extend the gospel to the ends of the earth.<br /><br />
We believe that this Church is an autonomous body, operating through democratic processes under the Lordship of Jesus Christ. In such a congregation members are equally responsible. Its scriptural officers are Pastors and deacons.<br /><br />
We believe that the New Testament speaks also of the church as the body of Christ which includes all the redeemed of all the ages.<br /><br />
Matt. 16:15-19; 18:15-20; Acts 2:41-42, 47; 5:11-14; 6:3-6; 13:1-3; 14:23, 27, 15:1- 30; 16:5; 20:28; Rom. 1:7; 1Cor. 1:2; 3:16; 5:4-5; 7:17; 9:13-14; 12; Eph. 1:22- 23; 2:19-22; 3:8-11, 21; 5:22-32; Phil. 1:1; Col. 1:18; 1Tim.3:1-15; 4:14; 1Pet. 5:1-4; Rev. 2-3; 21:2-3</li>

<li><b>Baptism and the Lord's Supper</b></li>
<ol type="i">
<li><b>Baptism</b>: We believe that Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It is an act of obedience symbolizing the believer's faith in a crucified, buried, and risen Saviour, the believer's death to sin, the burial of the old life, and the resurrection to walk in newness of life in Christ Jesus. It is a testimony to his faith in the final resurrection of the dead. Being a church ordinance, it is prerequisite to the privileges of church membership and to the Lord's Supper.</li>
<li><b>The Lord's Supper</b>: We believe that the Lord's Supper is a symbolic act of obedience whereby members of the church, through partaking of the bread and the fruit of the vine, memorialize the death of the Redeemer and anticipate His second coming.<br /><br />
Matt. 3:13-17; 26:26-30; 28:19-20; Mark 1:9-11; 14:22-26; Luke 3:21-22; 22:19-22; John 3:23; Acts 2:4-42; 8:35-39; 16:30-33; Acts 20:7; Rom.6:3-5; 1Cor. 10:16, 21; 11:23-29; Col. 2:12.</li>
</ol>

<li><b>The Lord's Day</b>: We believe that the first day of the week is the Lord's Day. It is a Christian institution for regular observance. It commemorates the resurrection of Christ from the dead and should be employed in exercises of worship and spiritual devotion, both public and private, and by refraining from worldly amusements, and resting from secular employments, work of necessity and mercy only being excepted.</li>

<li><b>Last Things</b>: We believe that God, in His own time and in His own way, will bring the world to its appropriate end. According to His promise, Jesus Christ will return personally and visibly in glory to the earth. Ex. 20:8-11; Matt. 12:1-12; 28:1ff; Mark 2:27-28; 16:1-7, Luke 24;1-3, 33-36; John 4:21-24; 20:1, 19-28; Acts 20:7; 1 Cor. 16:1-2; 3:16; Rev. 1-10.</li>
<ol type="i">
<li><b>The second coming of Christ</b>: We believe that Jesus is coming again. We believe no man knows the time or the season when Jesus will come again, but faithful to His promise, we look forward to the day of His return when Satan and sin shall be defeated forever.</li>
<li><b>The Judgement</b>: We believe that God has appointed a day, in which He will judge the world by Jesus Christ, when everyone shall receive according to his deeds; the wicked shall go away into everlasting punishment; the righteous, into everlasting life.</li>
<li><b>The Resurrection</b>: We believe that God has appointed a day wherein the bodies of all men will be raised, the righteous to the resurrection of life, and the unrighteous to eternal death.</li>
</ol>

<li><b>The Kingdom</b>: We believe that the kingdom of God includes both His general sovereignty over the universe and His particular kingship over men who willfully acknowledge Him as King. Particularly the kingdom is the realm of salvation into which men enter by trustful, childlike commitment to Jesus Christ. Christians ought to pray and to labour that the kingdom may come and God's will be done on earth. The full consummation of the kingdom awaits the return of Jesus Christ and end of this age.</li>

<li><b>The Christian and the Social Order</b>: We believe that every Christian is under obligation to seek to make the will of Christ supreme in his own life and in human society. Means and methods used for improvement of society and the establishment of righteousness among men can be truly and permanently helpful only when they are rooted in the regeneration of the individual by the saving grace of God in Christ Jesus. The Christian should oppose, in the spirit of Christ, every form of greed selfishness, and vice. He should work to provide for the orphaned, the needy, the aged, the helpless, and the sick. Every Christian should seek to bring industry, government, and society as a whole under the sway of the principles of righteousness, truth, and brotherly love. In order to promote these ends Christians should be ready to work with all men of good will in any good cause, always being careful to act in the spirit of love without compromising their loyalty to Christ and His truth.</li>
<li><b>The Family</b>: We believe that God has ordained the family as the foundational institution of human society. It is composed of persons related to one another by marriage, blood, or adoption.<br /><br />
<b>Marriage</b> is the uniting of one man and one woman in covenant commitment for a lifetime. It is God's unique gift to reveal the union between Christ and His Church and to provide for man and woman in marriage the framework for intimate companionship, the channel for sexual expression according to biblical standards, and the means for procreation of the human race.<br /><br />
The<b> husband and wife </b>are of equal worth before God, since both are created in God's image. The marriage relationship models the way God relates to His people. A husband is to love his wife as Christ loved the Church. He has the God- given responsibility to provide for, to protect and lead his family. A wife is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband even as the church willingly submits to the headship of Christ. She, being in the image of God as is her husband and thus equal to him, has the God-given responsibility to respect her husband and to serve as his helper in managing household and nurturing the next generation.
<br /><br />
Children, from the moment of conception, are a blessing and heritage from the Lord. Parents are to demonstrate to their children God's pattern for marriage. Parents are to teach their children spiritual and moral values and to lead them, through consistent lifestyle example and loving discipline, to make choices based on biblical truth. Children are to honour and obey their parents.<br /><br />

<h3><a id="covenant"></a>6.  The Church Covenant</h3>
<div class="indent">
<p class="description">Having been led as we believe by the Holy Spirit of God to receive the Lord Jesus Christ as our Lord and Saviour and, on the profession of our faith, having been baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, we do now in the presence of God and this assembly most solemnly and joyfully enter into covenant with one another as one body in Christ.</p>
<p class="description">We engage, therefore, by the aid of the Holy Spirit to walk together in Christian love; to strive for the advancement of this church in knowledge, holiness, and comfort; to promote its prosperity and spirituality; to sustain its worship, ordinances, doctrines, and disciplines; to contribute cheerfully and regularly to the support of the ministry, the expenses of the church, the relief of the poor, and the spread of the gospel through all nations.</p>
<p class="description">We also engage to maintain family and secret devotions; to religiously educate our children; to seek the salvation of our kindred and acquaintances; to walk circumspectly in the world; to be just in our dealings, faithful in our engagements, and exemplary in our deportment; to avoid all tattling, backbiting, and excessive anger; to abstain from the sale of and use of intoxicating drinks/alcohol as a beverage; to use our influence to combat the abuse of drugs and the spread of pornography; and to be zealous in our efforts to advance the kingdom of our Saviour.</p>
<p class="description">We further engage to watch over one another in brotherly love; to remember one another in prayer; to aid one another in sickness and distress; to cultivate Christian sympathy in feeling and Christian courtesy in speech; to be slow to take offense, but always ready for reconciliation and mindful of the rules of our Saviour to secure it without delay.</p>
<p class="description">We moreover engage that when we remove from this place, we will as soon as possible unite with some other church of like faith where we can carry out the spirit of this covenant and the principles of God's Word or finding none, will begin a Baptist Fellowship.</p>
</div>

<h3><a id="government"></a>7.  The Church Government</h3>
<ol class="typea" type="a">
<li><b>Doctrine</b>: This church receives the Scripture as its authority in matters of faith and practice.</li>
<li><b>Polity</b>: The government of this church is vested in the body of believers who make up its membership. Persons duly received by the members shall constitute the membership.</li>
<li><b>Relationships</b>: This church is subject to the control of no other ecclesiastical body, but it recognizes and sustains the obligations of mutual counsel and cooperation which are common among Baptist churches. Insofar as is practical, this church will endeavour to cooperate with and support the association, Baptist Fellowship of Zambia, or any other body in carrying out the missionary, educational, and benevolent ministry for the extension of Christ's Kingdom, as long as such co-operation involves no violation of conscience or compromise of loyalty for Christ and His word as revealed in the New Testament.</li>
