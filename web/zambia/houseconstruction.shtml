         <h3>1 October 2012</h3>

         <p class="cambria">In September 2012 Pastor Gabriel told Grace Notes
         sponsors that he would lose the plot he had purchased as a homestead,
         unless he were able to make some kind of improvement on the property.
         To satisfy the legal requirements, he needed $1500 to pay for the
         first phase of building, laying a foundation for a house.</p>

         <p class="cambria">At the time there were no funds for this, but on
         October 1, a Christian believer gave a grace gift of $1500, designated
         for getting the foundation built! We transmitted this immediately to
         Gabriel; it didn&#39;t take him long to spend it! :-)</p>

         <p class="cambria">Gabriel began work immediately. He was in a hurry
         because he wanted to have the foundation laid before the November
         rains in Zambia. He engaged a brother minister, Pastor Silvester
         Chipasha, to design and build the foundation. He also recruited
         several young men to help, students from the Bwacha High School, who
         wanted to earn money to pay their school fees.</p>

         <p class="cambria">It will be much less expensive for the Nsofwa&#39;s
         to own their own home than to pay rent.<br>
         [<b><a href="/zambia/photosfamily.shtml"
         target="_blank">Family Photos</a></b>]<br>
         Also, they will no longer be dependent on the whims of a landlord
         (laws for renters are very relaxed). The house Gabriel and Ruth have
         now is in the Mine district of Kabwe, which is very polluted. The new
         location is several miles north, in an area with much fewer health
         hazards. There will be more room for the family of seven; and Gabriel
         will have a small office space for church and Bible College work.</p>

         <p class="cambria">Silvester Chipasha is pastor of the Tabernacle
         River of Salvation Church, in the Nakoli Township of Kabwe. He is a
         student at Grace Bible College of Kabwe. The young workers are
         Christian teenage students at Bwacha High School. They are orphans,
         and they need this work to help pay their school fees. Pastor Nsofwa
         visits this school every month to preach the gospel at assemblies.
