         <p>We want to carry out the commission of our Lord Jesus Christ,
         through the Church's Bible teaching, preaching, and care ministries.
         Our mission is to bring the lost to Christ, help them develop into
         Christ-like maturity, and equip them for a life-saving Christian
         ministry, in the church and in the world-at-large.</p>

         <p>Our main objective for the church in Kabwe is to be a dynamic
         spiritual organism which the Holy Spirit uses to share Christ with
         as many people as possible, in our church and community, and to
         minister unselfishly to persons in the community and the
         world in Jesus' name.</p>

         <p><b>Note</b>: The townships from which we draw our membership are
         densely populated, with the majority of the people not in formal
         employment, following the liquidation of several government-owned
         parastatals (government-owned commercial enterprises) in the early
         1990's. Most of those who are employed are so poorly paid that they
         cannot adequately provide for their families. Sustenance for these
         folks is dependent upon small scale farming, business in local
         markets, or street vending.</p>

         <p class="cambria">In view of economic hardships, many young men and
         ladies have become involved with vices, such as prostitution and
         thieving, to earn a living. The Kabwe Church's challenge is to reach
         out and rehabilitate people through evangelism, Bible teaching, and
         counseling.</p>

         <p><b>*</b> "The Christian who does not understand what God has done
         in the past, and who does not have faith in what God will do in the
         future, will be overwhelmed by today's crisis." Chester McCalley</p>
