         <p class="cambria">Pastor Nsofwa visits more than 25 public schools every month, where he
         is allowed up to 20 minutes in school assemblies to give a gospel
         message. He has been doing this work for several years, and he is now
         able to preach the Word of God to as many as 23,000 primary, high
         school, and university students and their teachers on a regular
         basis.</p>

         <p class="cambria">This work has produced rich spiritual dividends as
         many hundreds of young people have come to know the Lord Jesus Christ.
         Some who have graduated have entered into their own lives of Christian
         service.</p>

         <p class="cambria">In his report for November 2012, Gabriel notes that
         transport costs were $375 for visiting forty-four (44) schools. The
         closest school was within walking distance from his home, so there was
         no transportation cost. The two most distant schools are 30 kilometers
         (18 miles) from his home, and they cost about $25 in round-trip
         fares.</p>

            <a href="../GraceGiving.shtml" target="_blank"><img src=
            "../images/GraceGiving.gif"></a>
         </div>

         <p class="cambria"><b>Challenge</b>: To raise $350 monthly so that
         Gabriel can use taxis when required to go to these schools. Currently,
         he only has funds for about 1/2 of his visits, the rest of the time he
         walks or uses public transport to cut down the walking distance.</p>
