              <p>The Christian who does not understand what God has done in
              the past, and who does not have faith in what God will do in the
              future, will be overwhelmed by today's crisis.</p>

            <p class="cambria">Many pastors and teachers use Grace Notes courses
            both for help in preparation for teaching and for use in classes held
            in Sunday schools, home schools, cell churches, and other venues where
            the Word of God is taught.</p>

            <p class="cambria">Grace Notes offers twelve (12) Units of course
            work, each unit roughly analogous to a semester of Bible College
            instruction. Students can earn certificates for each course completed,
            Unit certificates, and Diplomas for completing various portions of the
            curriculum. See the course descriptions here: <a href=
              "DiplomaCourses.shtml">Diplomas in Bible Teaching</a></p>
