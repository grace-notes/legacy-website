<h2>History 200 - The Temple: Its Ministry and Services at the Time of Christ</h2>
<p><b>by Alfred Edersheim</b><br>
"It has been my wish in this book, to take the reader back nineteen centuries; to show him Jerusalem as it was, when our Lord passed through its streets, and the Sanctuary, when He taught in its porches and courts; to portray, not only the appearance and structure of the Temple, but to describe its ordinances and worshippers, the ministry of its priesthood, and the ritual of its services." Alfred Edersheim</p>
